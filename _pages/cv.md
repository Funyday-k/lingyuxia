Education
======
* B.S. of Physics in Taishan College, Shandong University, 2025

>*Taishan College is the distinguished college of Shandong Univer- sity. Only about 20 students from freshmen can be selected for the Physics Orientation of Taishan College each year.*

Research Experience
======

* Scattering of Gravitational Wave

  Oct. 2022 - Present Institude of Frontier and Interdisciplinary science, Shandong Univer- sity, advised by Prof. Hong Zhang

  The project is to study the scattering of gravitational waves. For the tradi- tional scattering problem, we can use the partial wave method to analyze the wave function. But for the "classical potential" such as gravitational potential and Coulomb potential, the incident wave cannot be easily as- sumed by the plane wave, and the wave source itself will also affect the distribution of the wave propogation. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to analyze the distribution of wave function under the consideration of finite wave sources, and use analytical method and numerical numerircal to help us verify the conclusion.
* Numerical simulations of Active Galactic Nuclei, Mar. 2022 - Present

  Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, CAS, advised by Prof. Feng Yuan

  This is a ”Science and Technology Innovation Project” of the SAO, CAS. The formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the most important fun- damental sciences, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback has a crucial impact on galaxy evolution. We propose to use the advanced numerical simulation code Athena++, combined with knowledge of astrophysics and hydrodynamics to analyze some special phenonmenon.


Studying Experience
=====

* **Student-led study group–Taishan Seminar, May 2022-Present**

  In order to better learn the theoretical knowledge of physics, I, as one of the co-funders and contributors, jointly set up the Taishan Seminar. My classmates and I discuss mathematics and physics-related problems every week. And we established a website to upload notes and other materials for each discussion. Website: [physicsseminar.com](http://physicsseminar.com)
* **Hands-on project of axion and boson stars, Jan. 2023TDLI Winter Camp of Astrophysics, advised by Prof. Luca Visinelli**

  We study the method of estimating the mass of a boson star and Fried- mann equations, and numerically predict the upper bound of the mass using shooting method of ODE and the age of Universe.
