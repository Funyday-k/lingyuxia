My name is Xia Lingyu, and I hail from Jinan, Shandong, China. Currently, I am a physics enthusiast pursuing my education at Taishan College, Shandong University. As I approach my junior year, I am excitedly preparing for an upcoming exchange program at Bar-Ilan University in Israel.

My passion for physics knows no bounds, serving as the primary motivation for my continued studies in this captivating field. I am driven to explore and deepen my understanding of physics in the years ahead. Moreover, I have a broad range of interests. I find great joy in playing badminton and indulging in digital painting. I am also fervently engaged in staying informed about global events. Additionally, I have a profound appreciation for history and military matters, as they offer valuable insights that shape my unique perspectives on real-life situations.

I like to think of myself as an intriguing individual, as I possess a genuine love for social interactions and embrace the opportunity to make friends with people from all walks of life.
