Research Experience
======

* **Scattering of Gravitational Wave**,  Nov. 2022 - June 2025

  * *Institude of Frontier and Interdisciplinary science, Shandong Univer- sity, advised by Prof. Hong Zhang*

  In the study of scattering problems, a key obstacle is the lack of convergence of wave summation when calculating scattering amplitudes. In our work, we discard the assumption of plane wave incidence in the traditional fractional wave method, and consider the combined influence of the long-range forces of the wave source and the scattering source, so as to solve the problem of lack of convergence of scattering amplitude, and extract the physical information we need in the absence of analytical solutions of differential equations.

* **Gamma-Ray Bursts**, Nov. 2023 - Aug. 2024
  * *Department of Physics, Bar-Ilan University, advised by Prof. Peer Asaf*
  Research about GRB(Gamma-Ray Bursts).

* **Numerical simulations of Active Galactic Nuclei**, Mar. 2022 - Nov. 2022

  * *Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, CAS, advised by Prof. Feng Yuan*

  This is a Science and Technology Innovation Project of the SAO, CAS. We propose to use the advanced numerical
simulation code Athena++, combined with knowledge of astrophysics and hydrodynamics to analyze some special phenomenon.


Studying Experience
=====

* **Student-led study group–Taishan Seminar**, May 2022-Present

  In order to better learn the theoretical knowledge of physics, I, as one of the co-funders and contributors, jointly set up the Taishan Seminar. My classmates and I discuss mathematics and physics-related problems every week. And we established a website to upload notes and other materials for each discussion. Website: [physicsseminar.com](http://physicsseminar.com)

* **Hands-on project of axion and boson stars**, Jan. 
  * 2023TDLI Winter Camp of Astrophysics, advised by Prof. Luca Visinelli

  We study the method of estimating the mass of a boson star and Fried- mann equations, and numerically predict the upper bound of the mass using shooting method of ODE and the age of Universe.

* **The first Summer School of Basic Theory for top physics students**, July 2023

  The Summer School invited more than 20 experts and scholars, including academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to give lectures and participate in seminars for students. The summer School’s content includes in-depth learning of basic theories of physics, cutting-edge reports, teacher-student seminars, student exchanges, education and teaching forums, etc.
